A unified platform to manage MSOCIETY community.

This project is rewritten to Typescript from Go: https://gitlab.com/msociety/msocietybot

## Running

1. Run `npm i` command
2. Copy `env.sample` to `.env`
2. Setup database settings inside `.env` file
3. Run `npm start` command

### Running (with Docker)

```bash
# First time only:
$ docker-compose run database # Shut down after database has been set up

# Every other time:
$ docker-compose up
```

## Contributing

### Running tests
```bash
$ npm run test
```

### Output verbose logging
You can turn on debug (verbose) logging via supplying the env `DEBUG`:
```bash
$ DEBUG=telegraf:client,msocietybot npm run start
```

### Migration scripts
Migration scripts can be automatically generated by TypeORM:
```bash
$ npm run create-migration {migrationName}
```
It will work correctly as long as you have a db running with the latest migrations applied. TypeORM will calculate the differences using the schema to generate the new migrations.

### Migration scripts for tests
Due to an issue with TypeORM (sqlite) when doing recursive relationships (e.g. Message -> Message), the `syncronize` flag does not work and hence we have to also use migration scripts for testing:
```bash
$ npm run test:create-migration {migrationName}
# modify the generated migration scripts as per below *
$ npm run test:migrate
# above command is needed to update migration.db for tracking changes
```
\* When generating migration scripts for test, ensure any lines related to `temporary_messages` are removed.
